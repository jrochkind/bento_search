            "description": "The second edition of a guide, which introduced a simple, yet highly effective method for the relief of cancer pain. Thoroughly revised and updated, the new edition further refines the WHO method, which advocates the use of a small number of relatively inexpensive drugs, including morphine. Revisions draw on experiences with millions of patients around the world as well as new knowledge about the specific pain syndromes unique to cancer. Completely new are chapters describing the international system by which morphine and other opioids are made available for medical purposes. The book has two parts. Part one provides a practical guide to the relief of cancer pain, concentrating on drug treatment as the mainstay of pain management. The most extensive section sets out detailed guidelines for the selection and prescribing of non-opioid analgesics, opioid analgesics, drugs for neuropathic pain, and adjuvant drugs for the treatment of adverse effects, the enhancement of pain relief and the management of concomitant psychological disturbances. Information ranges from explanations of how specific drugs work, through the precautions to take in the presence of certain disorders, to a list of factors that influence the effectiveness of opioids. Concerning the use of opioids, readers are reminded that psychological dependence does not occur in cancer patients and that the only correct dose of morphine is the one that relieves the pain. Part two provides a guide to opioid availability. A discussion of the reasons why opioids continue to be underprescribed or difficult to obtain is followed by an explanation of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.",

            "description": "The epidemiological and clinical importance of bone metastasis has long been recognized, but the past decade has seen an explosion in the fields of bone biology and bone cancer research. This period of time has been marked by a number of key discoveries that have led to the opening up of entirely new areas for investigation as well as new therapies which combine surgery and biological therapeutic approaches. Bone is a common site of cancer metastases - cancer cells commonly develop in bone and spread to other organ systems through the bloodstream. For example, the incidence of bone metastases in breast and prostate cancers is 70%, whereas it is only 30 to 40% in metastatic lung cancer. In clinical terms, bone metastases have substantial negative effects on a patient's quality of life and are a main cause of patient mortality. Given the global prevalence of breast and prostate cancers, knowledge of bone biology has become essential for the medical and cancer research communities. This book provides, all in one resource, the most recent data on bone cancer development (cellular and molecular mechanisms), genomic and proteomic analyses, clinical analyses (histopathology, imaging, pain monitoring), as well as new therapeutic approaches and clinical trials for primary bone tumors and bone metastases. Feature Presents a comprehensive, translational source for all aspects of bone cancer in one reference work Bone cancer experts (from all areas of research and practice) take readers from the bench research (cellular and molecular mechanism), through genomic and proteomic analysis, all the way to clinical analysis (histopathology and imaging) and new therapeutic approaches. Clear presentation by bone biologists of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying bone tumors and bone cancer metastasis as well as the genomic and proteomic assays used in detecting cancer within given organ systems Clear presentation by oncologists and radiologists of how histopathology, imaging, and pain monitoring can lead to new therapeutic approaches Benefit Saves researchers and clinicians time in quickly accessing the very latest details on a broad range of bone cancer issues, as opposed to searching through thousands of journal articles. Provides a common language for cancer researchers, bone biologists, oncologists, and radiologists to discuss bone tumors and how bone cancer metastases affects each major organ system Correct diagnosis (and therefore correct treatment) of cancer depends on a strong understanding of the molecular basis for the disease – both oncologists and radiologists will benefit Bone biologists will gain insight into how clinical observations and practices can feed back into the research cycle and will, therefore, be able to develop more targeted genomic and proteomic assays",

Written by leading international physicians and investigators, this innovative multi-disciplinary book presents the most up-to-date research and clinical approaches. Coverage is given to progress in a variety of clinical settings, including programs of organ and function preservation, curative treatments, unresectable disease, adjuvant treatments in high-risk patients, and recurrent/metastatic disease. Complementary to the techniques of surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic treatments, the authors present data on epidemiology, molecular pathology, normal tissue complications, rehabilitation, palliative care, and treatment in the elderly. State-of-the-art functional imaging is elucidated; and the latest developments in high precision techniques in irradiation, sequencing of chemo- and radiotherapy, as well as the integration of biomolecular therapies into cytotoxic treatments are explored.",

Cancer Modelling and Simulation demonstrates how mathematical modelling and computer simulation techniques are used to discover and gain insight into the dynamics of tumour development and growth. It highlights the benefits of tumour modelling, such as discovering optimal tumour therapy schedules, identifying the most promising candidates for further clinical investigation, and reducing the number of animal experiments. By examining the analytical, mathematical, and biological aspects of tumour growth and modelling, the book provides a common language and knowledge for professionals in several disciplines.",

It is a practically-based text for clinical nurses who wish to consolidate and update their knowledge of cervical cancer. It is concise, containing comprehensive information for general practice together with useful references to facilitate more in-depth study. Thus it provides an invaluable resource for both the registered nurse with a general interest in cervical cancer and for the nurse specialist working in primary health, gynaecology, oncology and palliative care. As well as containing the essential chapters about the pathophysiology and treatment of cervical abnormalities and cervical cancer, the book also addresses specific nursing issues such as sexuality, fertility, and symptom control. Moreover it examines the bigger, global picture of the disease. Full appreciation of global impact of cervical cancer on women involves an appreciation of the social, political and public health aspects of the disease – not only in the developed world but also in developing countries.",

The clinical pharmacology of individual anti-cancer agents are covered, including the most important recently registered novel anti-cancer drugs. This book will prove an invaluable source of information for all trainees in oncology, haematology and internal medicine. Since cancer clinical pharmacology is a vast subject this book will be useful for all individuals involved in cancer pharmacology such as nurses, pharmacists, general pharmacologists, and cancer scientists.",
